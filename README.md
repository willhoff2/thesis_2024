# thesis_2024

This repo includes the code used to create the body of my thesis "Hybrid Domain-Transfer Approach for Resolution Increase within Data-Constrained Paleoclimatic Proxy Records"

It is broken down as such:

  - data: SVID Image and %TOC data

  - experiment_results: The experimental results from the code in experiment_scripts. Broken down into tables and plots

  - experiment_scripts: Scripts for running experiments for moving average, sequential, grid searches and t-SNE.

  - preproccessing: simple_datasets script for the creation of training and test sets


The rest of the data for the scripts are forthcoming; however, only SVID %TOC data is available until the publication of the rest.

The MA Data experiments can not be run until the entirety of the data is made available; however, the scripts and functions are still present and can be modified to be ran with the current state of the data.
